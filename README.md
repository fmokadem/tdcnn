# CNN Compression using Hierarchical Tucker Decomposition (HTD)

This repository contains experiments on compressing CNNs using Hierarchical Tucker Decomposition (HTD). The experiments focus on applying HTD to fintuned AlexNet, VGG16, and ResNet18 models. Finetune code is available in finetuned -models are too large for github to accept. 

## Overview

The primary goal is to explore the trade-offs between model compression (reduction in parameters and FLOPs) and performance metrics (accuracy) when applying HTD to different CNN architectures.

Non Uniform rank selections for Conv2D layers outperforms unifrom low rank approximation througout the layers. Challenge is rank selections. 

Probabilistic methods like VBMF and Numerical methods like Singular Value Energy based threshholding perform well, but not as optimal as search and require many epochs of finetune. 

Here, we exploit the rank search space guided by a policy pdf approximated using the heuristics of layer sensitivity to decomposition and conv2d layer size. Outperfoms all methods, using only ~100 searches with <=3 epoch of finetune.  

## Repository Structure

*   **.ipynb Notebooks:** (`htd-alexnet-res.ipynb`, `htd-vgg-res.ipynb`, `htd-resnet-res.ipynb`)
    *   Each notebook performs the HTD experiment for a specific model (AlexNet, VGG16, ResNet18).
    *   They load a pre-trained model, identify convolutional layers, generate HTD configurations, apply compression, optionally fine-tune the compressed model, evaluate performance, and log results.
*   **`common/`:** Contains shared utility functions for dataset loading, logging, model loading, evaluation metrics, and HTD implementation details (like `replace_conv2d_with_tucker`).
*   **`finetuned/`:** Likely contains the pre-trained models used as a starting point for compression.
*   **`jsonify_logs.py`:** A script to convert experiment log files into JSON format.
*   **`analyze_results.py`:** A script to analyze the logged results from the experiments, likely comparing different compression configurations.
*   **`logs/`:** (Not included in repo, but generated by notebooks) Directory where experiment logs are saved.
*   **`*.png`, `*.txt`:** Files possibly generated by `analyze_results.py` summarizing findings.

## Fine-tuning

The experiment notebooks include an option (`FINETUNE = True`) to perform a brief fine-tuning step (e.g., 3 epochs) on the compressed model. This helps recover some accuracy potentially lost during the compression process.
